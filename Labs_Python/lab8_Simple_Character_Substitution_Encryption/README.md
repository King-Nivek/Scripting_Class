##Simple Character Substitution Encryption 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple character substitution encryption program for text files written in Python; that allows the user to specify a text file to be encrypted with the encrypted file created as output.  Once the file is specified an encrypted version will be created that will have a prefix of “encrypted_” added to the original file name.  Alternatively, you can specify the path to the encrypted file and also provide the argument “-d” which will tell the program to decrypt the file and it will output the decrypted file with the prefix “decrypted_” added to the original file name while removing the “encrypted_” prefix if it is found as part of the name of the file. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in this project is my test text file and a helper program called “counting” that I used to help me in my initial substitution of characters to find a nice balance in what was getting substituted and where.
